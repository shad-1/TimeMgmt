# TimeMgmt
### An ASP.NET MVC Web app for organizing tasks according to Steven Covey's suggestions. 

## Reminders to devs:
- Best practice is to create a branch, do your work on that branch, then submit a pull request for your work to be merged into `main`.
- To create a branch, you can use `git switch -c <branch name>` or `git checkout -b <branch name>` (switch is the newer version of this command, but both work. 
- When you create a branch and push work to that branch for the first time, you will likely see an error message saying you need to set the upstream branch. Use the suggested command from that message (something like `git push --set-upstream origin <branch name>`).
- Create Pull Requests in github.
